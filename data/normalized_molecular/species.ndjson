It is clearly present on the reproduction of Ogawa and Ogawa, 1972 , but these authors consider the first band at 950 Å as due to v'=1 of K(4pσ)←X.

Dieke and Mauchly, 1933 derived B 0 = 1.89 from lines with N values between 7 and 15.

The N=1 levels lie below N=0 for v=0 and 1; meaningful B values cannot be given until the whole d and f complexes have been fully analyzed, see Ginter, 1967 . 32 The fine structure in the N=1 levels of both ortho- and para-H 2 has been observed in microwave-optical double resonance by Freund and Miller, 1973 who give A e = 0.0281 Freund and Miller, 1973 as well as spin-spin coupling constants. For para-H 2 , v=0, N=1, the three component levels J=1,2, and 0 are at -0.01241, -0.00695, and +0.07197 cm -1 , respectively. For ortho-H 2 the hyperfine structure has also been studied. 33 Constants refer to 3 Π - . 3 Π + is strongly perturbed, i.e. the Λ - type doubling is fairly large and irregular Dieke, 1935, 2 . 34 Breaking-off of P and R branches ( 3 Π + ) above v'=3 on account of predissociation.

Dieke, 1958 gives T 0 = 95226 without explanation; the most recent theoretical value is T 0 = 95077.3 Kolos, 1975 . The T e value in the table takes account of Y 00 in both upper (Y' 00 = 4.9 2 ) and lower state. 37 ω e y e = +0.92. Precise ab initio potential function (including diagonal corrections) and predicted vibrational levels in Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1968 .

T e takes account of Y 00 in both upper (Y' 00 = 4.1 8 ) and lower state. 41 The Λ-type doubling is quite small (~ 0.5 cm -1 for N=6); the constants refer to the average. The triplet splitting in N=2 of para-H 2 has been fully resolved in molecular beam experiments of Lichten, 1960 yielding Δν(J=2-1) = 0.16438 Lichten, 1960 , Δν(J=2-3) = 0.19674 cm -1 Lichten, 1960 with J=2 at the top. The hyperfine structure in N=1,J=2 of ortho-H 2 is Δν(F=3-2) = 0.0236 Frey and Mizushima, 1962 , Δν(F=2-1) = 0.0154 cm -1 Frey and Mizushima, 1962 as quoted by Frey and Mizushima, 1962 . Foster and Richardson, 1953 give spin splittings for N = 1,2,3,4,5 without resolving J=N+l from J=N-1. 42 The levels of c 3 Π u + are strongly predissociated by the b 3 Σ u + state Herzberg, 1967 ; the levels of c 3 Π u - are either very weakly affected by a forbidden predissociation to b 3 Σ u + Lichten, 1962 , Chiu, 1964 or decay radiatively (by magnetic dipole radiation) to the b 3 Σ u + state as suggested by the lifetime measurements of Johnson, 1972 , τ(v=0)= 1.02 ms Johnson, 1972 independent of spin component and isotope. Johnson, 1974 observed quenching of c 3 Π u - in an electric field. The Stark effect is large (~ E+4 times greater than for the ground state) and has been studied experimentally by Kagann and English, 1976 and compared with the theoretical values of English and Albritton, 1975 . 43 This number, obtained from ν 00 (a-X) + ν 00 (e-a) + ν 00 (g-e) - ν 00 (g-c), is 87 cm -1 higher than given in MOLSPEC 1, a change made necessary by the work of Gloersen and Dieke, 1965 . See also 36 . 44 Theoretical and experimental values for the ionization probability into the various vibrational levels of H 2 + are given by Dunn, 1966 , Villarejo, 1968 , Nicholls, 1968 , Ford, Docken, et al., 1975 and Villarejo, 1968, 2 , Turner, 1968 , respectively. The ionization cross section near the ionization limit has been studied at high resolution by Chupka and Berkowitz, 1968 , Comes and Wellern, 1968 . See also Backx, Wight, et al., 1976 . 45 For high n there is strong l-uncoupling and the two series of 1 Σ u + and 1 Π u + levels of para-H 2 should be called np0 and np2, respectively, corresponding to the fact that the first converges to N=0, the second to N=2 of H 2 + There are strong systematic perturbations between the J=1 levels of these two series (because of l- uncoupling) so that the formulae as given do not represent the series very well. An accurate representation can be obtained by Fano's quantum defect theory; see Herzberg and Jungen, 1972 . Levels of npπ, 1 Π u + above N=0 of H 2 + are preionized resulting in asymmetrically broadened absorption lines with apparent emission wings. 46 Limits of Rydberg series above v\\\"=0, J\\\"=0. 47 Chupka, Dehmer, et al., 1975 have observed Rydberg levels with v = 9,10,11 in the study of ion-pair formation. 48 These two series of ortho levels are essentially unperturbed. 49 Average of Π + and Π - . ν 00 referred to (N'=0). 50 Refers to Π - ; Π + is perturbed; B 0 (Π + ) = 30.178, B 1 (Π + ) = 31.370. 51 RKR potential function in Monfils, 1968, 2 . 52 Refers to Π - ; γ e = -0.53.

The observed value for J=0 [perturbed by B'(v=4)] is 116885.6 according to Namioka, 1964 and 116885.3 according to Monfils, 1965 , while in the more recent paper Monfils, 1968 gives 116882.00. 65 All these states are considered as doubly excited states by Dieke, 1958 . They may well form one or two double-minimum states (similar to E, F) together with H 1 Σ g + . 66 Only v=0. 67 This is the λ4142.8 progression of Richardson, 1934 as revised by Dieke, 1958 . 68 These values agree with Dieke, 1958 ; Richardson, 1934 gives 23057.22 and 23191.66 for L and M, respectively. 69 3 1 0 of Richardson, 1934 . 70 From R(0) of the 0-0 band and F(1)-F(0) as given by Richardson, 1934 .

See also 73 . 72 The rotational constants Namioka, 1964 represent only the levels v= 0, 1, 2 of Π - . The Π + levels are strongly perturbed by the B' state which also causes the predissociation of 1 Π + for v'≥ 3; see 73 . Monfils, 1965 gives for the deperturbed values: B v (Π + )= 32.5 1 - 2.00(v+1/2) + 0.071(v+1/2) 2 - 0.0040(v+1/2) 3 ; B v (Π - )= 30.8 1 - 1.96(v+1/2) + 0.102(v+1/2) 2 - 0.0053(v+1/2) 3 . 73 Strong predissociation for v'≥3; no bands with v'≥3 have ever been observed in emission.

The Λ-type doubling for v=0, J=1 is 4.2 cm -1 with Π + above Π - . 77 These constants Ginter, 1967 refer to Π - and Δ - and take into account the effects of l- uncoupling in the d-complex according to the formulae of Ginter, 1966 . They cannot be used to derive energy levels without the use of these formulae. The observed levels are given in Dieke, 1958 . 78 The forbidden 1 Δ g → 1 Σ u - transition occurs because of strong uncoupling in the upper state. Only Q branches are observed in these bands. 79 Refers to J=2 of Δ - at 10.8 cm -1 below J=2 of Δ + . 80 3 1 B of Richardson, 1934 , 3E of Dieke, 1958 . Mulliken, 1964 and Browne, 1965 predict a fairly high (0.4 eV) maximum in the potential function of this state. 81 Zeeman effect studies Dieke, Cunningham, et al., 1953 yield g(v=0,J=1) = 0.49 8 Dieke, Cunningham, et al., 1953 , g(v=0,J=2) = 0.412 Dieke, Cunningham, et al., 1953 , etc.; lifetime τ(v=0,J=2) = 38 ns van der Linde and Dalby, 1972 , see 85 . 82 Referred to J'=1 of I 1 Π - ; J=1 of I 1 Π + is 62.32 cm -1 higher. 83 3 1 C of Richardson, 1934 , 3D of Dieke, 1958 . 84 No levels higher than v=3 have been observed which suggests that the dissociation limit is 1 2 S + 2 2 S, 2 P at 118377.6 cm -1 . The constants represent only v=0,1,2. 85 This value Richardson, 1934 does not represent the low rotational levels because of l-uncoupling, e.g. the J=1 level is below J=0.

See 93 . 91 ω e x e = +3.533(v+1/2) 3 - 0.93750(v+1/2) 4 ; these are the constants of Namioka, 1964 [except T e which is taken from Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 ], they apply only to v=0,...,4. Monfils, 1968 gives a very different set of constants based on seven levels v=0,...,6. The ΔG curve (in H 2 , HD, and D 2 ) has a characteristic tail which makes representation of the higher vibrational levels by a conventional formula meaningless Namioka, 1964 , Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 . 92 RKR potential functions Namioka, 1965 , Monfils, 1968, 2 . A very slight maximum of the potential function at 2.9 Angstroms has been predicted by Ford, Browne, et al., 1975 but not confirmed in the calculations of Kolos, 1976 ; see also Wolniewicz, 1975 . The experimental data, while suggesting an anomalous form of the potential function, do not indicate a maximum Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 . 93 a v = +0.540(v+1/2) 2 - 0.091 7 (v+1/2) 3 ; these constants Namioka, 1964 represent only the first five (deperturbed) B v values. If only three levels are used B v = 26.371- 1.9000(v+1/2)-0.0050(v+1/2) 2 leading to a very different Y 00 value (3.6) from the one used here (see 90 ). 94 The higher D v values are quite irregular. 95 The T e values for B and C include the effects of Y 00 on the zero point energies in both upper and lower states; Y' 00 (B) = 8.7, Y' 00 (C) = 5.0 cm -1 . On the other hand, the T e value of C 1 Π u and ν 00 (C-X) exclude the term - BΛ 2 in the energy formula, a term that is usually included to form part of the effective potential energy. With this inclusion and disregarding Y 00 Namioka, 1965 gives T e = 100063.42 and ν 00 = 99090.35 on the basis of older data for v=0...4 and his own precise data for v=5....13. 96 From the 0-1 band of Porto and Jannuzzi, 1963 ; from T 0 (B')-T 0 (E) one obtains 11313.6 2 . 97 RKR Franck-Condon factors Spindler, 1969 .

The most detailed calculation of the potential function and the energy levels is that of Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1969 whose numbering and ΔG(1/2) value for the F 1 Σ g - component has been adopted in the table. According to Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1969 ν 00 (F-B) would be at 9146.8 cm -1 but v=0,1,2,3 of F have not been observed. The observed v=4 level lies just below the potential maximum. 99 From the observed ν 40 and the energy of v=4 above the (outer) minimum as calculated by Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1969 . 100 B 4 = 6.24 129 101 R 4 =2.31 5 129 102 Franck-Condon factors Lin, 1974 .

Owing to the interaction of E and F (see 98 ) higher ΔG(v+1/2), B v , D v values are irregular. 105 ω e x e = +0.73l2(v+1/2) 3 - 0.04l5(v+1/2) 4 . These constants refer to the (unperturbed) Π - component and are based on an 8-level fit to the data of Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 [v=0-4] and Namioka, 1964, 2 [v=5-7]. Somewhat different constants are given by Namioka, 1965 . Note, that the T e values in Dieke, 1958 are too low by 8.4 cm -1 Namioka, 1965 . The constants of Monfils, 1968 are affected by not recognizing this error. 106 Theoretical work King and Van Vleck, 1939 , Mulliken, 1960 , Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1965 , Rothenberg and Davidson, 1966 , Kolos, 1967 has predicted, and the analysis of the spectrum Namioka, 1964 , Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 has confirmed, that the potential curve of C 1 Π u has a van der Waals maximum of ~ 105 cm -1 above the asymptote near r=4.8 Angstroms. ab initio potential function (without diagonal corrections) and predicted vibrational levels Kolos and Wolniewicz, 1968 .

On the other hand, the T e value of C 1 Π u and ν 00 (C-X) exclude the term - BΛ 2 in the energy formula, a term that is usually included to form part of the effective potential energy. With this inclusion and disregarding Y 00 Namioka, 1965 gives T e = 100063.42 and ν 00 = 99090.35 on the basis of older data for v=0...4 and his own precise data for v=5....13. 111 ω e x e = +0.7196(v+1/2) 3 - 0.0598(v+1/2) 4 +0.002l6(v+1/2) 5 , Y 00 = 8.7; from a least squares fit Dabrowski and Herzberg, 1974 to the first eight levels as given by Herzberg and Howe, 1959 .
